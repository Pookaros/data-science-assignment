# Iris Classification Project

## How to use

Just run the markdown file (presentation.ipynb) block by block. It presents my thoughts along the process as well as the code used for the flash app. At the last block the flask aplication will start. Along the way all the nescesary files for the application to work will already have been created. For each model we have a set of hyperparameters, a set of evaluation metrics and the dataset it was trained on. Just click the Reload Model Log button when the flask application is open in your browser.
