# Iris Classification Project

## Dataset Description

This project uses the Iris dataset, a small classic dataset from Fisher, 1936, which is one of the earliest known datasets used for evaluating classification methods.

- **Dataset Files:**
  - `iris.dataset`: Contains the Iris dataset.
  - `iris.names`: Contains the description of the dataset.

For more information about the dataset, visit [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).



# Project Overview

This project aims to go through the key steps of a data science workflow including dataset loading and preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and serving the results through a Flask web app. We encourage the use of Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

###  Create Your Own Branch

Create your own branch for the project with the naming convention `feature-yourgithubusernamehere-solution`.
## 1. Dataset Loading and Preprocessing

- **Objective**: Load the dataset using Pandas and prepare it for analysis and modeling. Ensure the data is clean and properly structured.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Handle missing values appropriately.
  - Perform any necessary type conversions.
  - Encode categorical variables if required.

## 2. Visualize the Dataset

- **Objective**: Create plots to visualize the dataset and understand its characteristics.
- **Tools**: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn for generating visualizations.
- **Suggestions**:
  - Plot distribution of key features.
  - Visualize relationships between features.

## 3. Train a Classifier

- **Objective**: Choose a suitable classifier from a Python machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and train it on the dataset.
- **Considerations**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Perform any necessary feature scaling or normalization.

## 4. Evaluate the Model

- **Objective**: Assess the performance of the trained model using an appropriate metric.
- **Metric Suggestions**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, etc.
- **Documentation**: Document your findings and insights from the model evaluation.

## 5. Store the Metric

- **Objective**: Save the evaluation metrics results for future reference or comparison.
- **Implementation**:
  - Store metrics in a file or database.
  - Ensure the storage method is accessible for future retrieval from the Flask Web App.

## 6. Serve the Metric through a Flask Web App

- **Objective**: Develop a Python Flask web app that serves the stored metric.
- **Requirements**:
  - The app should display the metric upon request.
  - Hint: It is just a simple endpoint nothing fancy.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Fork the Repository**: Before making any changes, fork the repository to your own account.
- **Branch Naming Conventions**: Follow the specified naming conventions for branches.
- **Code Documentation**: Ensure your code is well-documented and adheres to the Python PEP 8 style guide.
- **Pull Requests**: Open a pull request with a detailed description of your changes for review.
